This folder has led code for STM32F407vg
This a very basic programming to start learning about STM32F407vg board
Please check the Technical Reference Manual simultaniously for more info.
We are using STM32F407 Standard Peripheral library functions.
Copy GPIO and RCC folders from STM32F4xx_DSP_StdPeriph_Lib_V1.8.0\Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Examples.
Paste them in STM32F4xx_DSP_StdPeriph_Lib_V1.8.0\Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates
Goto STM32F4xx_DSP_StdPeriph_Lib_V1.8.0\Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates\MDK-ARM
Open a uVision file with name "Project"
Replace main.c with led_source.c file.
Compile your project and flash it into STM32F407vg board.
