This projects is for generating a 1ms timer for delay or any other purpose in STM32F407.

1)  Timer will have it's clock. Here we are using Timer-2 and clock is 84MHz.
2)  A prescalar divides the clock and gives the desired desired clock as output (Prescalar is a 16 Bit register)

    84MHz / (8399+1)  = 10KHz is the output clock for the prescalar value
    
    frequency = 1/time;   --->    time = 1/10KHz ---> time = 0.1ms
    
3)
