This projects is for generating a 2 Seconds timer interrupt in STM32F407.

1)  Timer will have it's clock. Here we are using Timer-2 and clock is 84MHz.
2)  A prescalar divides the clock and gives the desired desired clock as output (Prescalar and period are 16 Bit register)

    84MHz / (41999+1)  = 2KHz is the output clock for the prescalar value
    
    frequency = 1/time;   --->    time = 1/2KHz ---> time = 0.5ms
    
3)  Period is for updating the timer over flow.

    Period value for 2 Seconds will be
    
    1           ---->        0.5 ms
    4000        <----       2000 msec

4)  Invoke interrupt for Toggle green LED.
